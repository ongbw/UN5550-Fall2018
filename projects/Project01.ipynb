    "    * \"Petal ratio\" : the ratio of the petal length to petal width\n",
    "    * \"Sepal ratio\" : the ratio of the sepal length to sepal width\"\n",
    "4. For each species, determine the mean, median, minimum, maximum and standard deviation of the petal and sepal ratio.  You may wish to group data according to species (see section 2.6.7) and use a descriptive summary statistic (see page 15)"
